# rollingDices
## My 1st nearly self-made browser game, which i wrote though the JS Course.
I decided to learn JavaScript and become a front-end developer, so i bought a very nice course by Jonas Schmedtmann on UDEMY https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/
And this is a very simple browser game which i wrote by myself (actually i just followed the instructions but i guess it's already a beginning)

# --- THE RULES ---
So there are 2 players who rolles the dice. The winner is the first who will reach 100 points. You may roll as many times as you want but if you roll 1, all of your
points will be lost and the turn goes to another player. That's why you need the HOLD button to save your points. When you press it, the turn also goes to another player.

###### Enjoy!
And please respond in case you have some ideas, questions or comments.
